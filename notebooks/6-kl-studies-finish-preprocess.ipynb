    "- Consider using sklearn.feature_extraction.text CountVectorizer to create a column for each ngram. Or, instead of counting the number of every single ngram, extract the count of key words/ngrams in each review. Can use NLTK to filter out rare ngrams or do pmi (comparing ngrams) \n",
    "- Assign words (or even ngrams?) in reviews tfidf scores using TfidfVectorizer in order to add weight to more important words for predictive purposes. (Use case: large corpus, want to simplify them into fewer words for application)\n",
    "- Generate word embeddings using spacy's pretrained model: use a larger spacy model if using word embedding. Generate a word vector for each word. Check out \"Beyond n-grams: word embeddings\" lesson in Data Camp course Feature Engineering for NLP in Python. Can also use different methods for creating word emboeddings, i.e. WordVec, GloVe. (Use case: working with word nuances, relationships, semantics)\n",
