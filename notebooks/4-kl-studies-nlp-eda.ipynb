I have no health insurance so was getting it on some program that made it cost me $6 but when they would screw up the order  I would either run out or have to get the full amount which was $13000 at the 10mgs so X 2 for 20mg x 4 for 40mgs!! Just because of the way the pharmacy was doing itScamming the federal programs or  somethingso I finally just quit taking it I definately had noticed that it made pee without barely any warning and my eyesight got alot worse and my fiance said it made me mean All that has stopped now that I am not on it But my ADD is back full force!

I feel better than ever and am totally clear headed and able to consentrate  For the first time in as long as I can remember I can think normally!  No more racing thoughts in my head and my depression and anxiety has all but vanashed!  I do still take an antidepressive but I am CERTAIN that the Vyvanse gave the antidepression meds the ability to work  I can FINALLY sleep a normal 7 to 9 hours and still be awake and alert throughout my 12hour work days  I was worried that the Vyvanse would elevate my anxiety level but the opposite occured!  My anxiety is all but absent and I no longer have the need to continue with my antianxiety meds!  There is NO SUBSTITUTE for a Doctor who is a specialist in mental health  Spend the money and see!  A good Psychiatrist will spend HOURS with you before making a diagnosis and if Adult ADD is what you have then give Vyvanse a try  It worked GREAT for me and my live has turned around for the better  It is the best remedy that I have found in 15 years!  You MUST take it when you awaken for your day because it takes about 1215 hours to get out of your system  If you take it later in the day  you will experaince insomnia  Ask your SPECIALIST about Vyvanse Dry mouth  which is great because I now drink a lot of water instead of sodas because the sodas do not quinch my thirst  Clear headed Able to complete projects without procastination 100% help with shortterm memory lessened depression and anxiety no more obsessive eating weight loss'"
